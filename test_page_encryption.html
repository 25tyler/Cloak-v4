    <h1>Automatic Page Encryption Test</h1>
    
    <div class="info">
        <p><strong>This page demonstrates automatic encryption.</strong> All text on this page should be encrypted automatically when the page loads. The encryption happens with a single API call.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="article">
        <h2>Sample Article One</h2>
        <p>This is the first paragraph of the article. It contains some text that should be encrypted automatically. The encryption system will process all text nodes on the page in a single API call.</p>
        <p>Here is another paragraph with more content. The system extracts all text from the page, sends it to the API once, and then replaces all the text with encrypted versions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="article">
        <h2>Sample Article Two</h2>
        <p>This is a second article on the same page. All of its text should also be encrypted automatically. The encryption uses a custom font to display the encrypted text as readable content.</p>
        <p>Multiple paragraphs and sections are all handled in one go. There's no need to configure anything or add special markup to the HTML.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="article">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The encryption script extracts all text nodes from the page, sends them to the API in a single request, receives encrypted versions back, and then replaces the original text with encrypted text while applying a custom font that makes it readable.</p>
